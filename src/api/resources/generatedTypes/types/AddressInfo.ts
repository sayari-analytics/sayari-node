 * A physical location description. Addresses may exist as a simple string ("123 South Main St., South Bend, IN 46556"), or may be in smaller chunks with separate fields ("Number: 123", "Street name: South Main ..."). Where possible, these fields will be parsed using the [Libpostal ontology](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal#parser-labels), which facilitates more robust address analysis and comparison.
