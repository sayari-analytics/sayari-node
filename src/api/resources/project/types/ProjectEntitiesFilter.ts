/**
 * Filter for entities in a project. The format is `field=value`, where the equal sign is encoded as `%3D`. Supported fields are as follows
 *
 * - risk Filter by [risk factor](/sayari-library/ontology/risk-factors) ID. - upstream_risk Filter by upstream (supply chain) [risk factor](/sayari-library/ontology/risk-factors) ID. - country Filter by [country](/sayari-library/ontology/enumerated-types#country). - upstream_country Filter by upstream (supply chain) [country](/sayari-library/ontology/enumerated-types#country). - business_purpose Filter by HS code, HS code description, or business description. - label.fuzzy Filter by entity label with fuzzy matching. - city.fuzzy Filter by entity city with fuzzy matching. - state.fuzzy Filter by entity address state with fuzzy matching. - identifier.fuzzy Filter by entity identifier attributes with fuzzy matching. - source.exact Filter by entity source ID. - status.exact Filter by entity [company status](/sayari-library/ontology/enumerated-types#company-status). - bounds Filter by a geographical bounding box. The value is a pipe-delimited set of four values representing the top, left, bottom, and right sides of the bounding box, in that order. The pipes should be URL-encoded as `%7C`. The top coordinate must greater than the bottom coordinate, and the left coordinate must be less than the right coordinate. A sample is `55.680357237879136|-71.53607290158526|41.10876347746233|-40.963927098414736`
